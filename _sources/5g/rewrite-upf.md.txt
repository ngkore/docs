![alt text](photos/rewrite-upf/rewrite-upf-01.webp)

In the ever-evolving world of 5G, the User Plane Function (UPF) is the backbone of ultra-fast data delivery. But with increasing throughput, low-latency expectations, and the explosion of IoT devices, traditional kernel networking struggles to keep up. This is where the eBPF/XDP stack steps in ‚Äî offering programmable, high-performance packet processing right at the NIC level.

In this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into:

## What is XDP (eXpress Data Path)?
The image above illustrates the complete journey of a packet as it enters, traverses, and exits the Linux kernel networking stack. It‚Äôs a layered overview that shows key processing points ‚Äî and crucially, where we can intercept packets for filtering, forwarding, or dropping.

## Interpreting the Packet Flow Diagram
This diagram breaks down into four main layers:

- **Link Layer** (Blue): Represents early packet handling ‚Äî this is where drivers hand packets over to the kernel.
- **Network Layer** (Green): Deals with routing, connection tracking, NAT, etc.
- **Protocol Layer** (Yellow): Handles L4-specific protocols (e.g., TCP/UDP).
- **Application Layer** (Red): Involves sockets and user applications.

Now, look to the very left of the diagram ‚Äî you‚Äôll notice the XDP eBPF block right after the (start) point. This is where XDP hooks into the NIC driver before the packet is even handed off to the kernel via alloc_skb(). It‚Äôs the earliest and fastest possible interception point for packet processing in Linux.

This means:

- The kernel hasn‚Äôt allocated memory (sk_buff) yet.
- There‚Äôs no need to traverse Netfilter, iptables, or even socket buffers if you don‚Äôt want to.
- XDP can redirect, drop, or pass packets with near-zero overhead.

## Why This Matters
By working here:

- You bypass costly layers like Netfilter, qdisc, and the full routing logic.
- You can implement line-rate filtering, DDOS mitigation, or even user plane packet forwarding directly from the driver.

This is why eBPF/XDP-based UPFs can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional userland UPFs that rely on Kernel stack, or Netfilter hooks.

## XDP Modes
XDP can run in several modes depending on your NIC capabilities and use case:

**Native Mode (Driver Mode)**

- Runs directly inside the NIC driver (best performance, true zero-copy).
- Performance scales with CPU cores and driver quality ‚Äî not offloaded to NIC hardware.
- Requires driver support (e.g., ixgbe, mlx5, virtio-net). supported_drivers_list

**Generic Mode**

- Runs in the kernel after packet allocation (skb exists).
- Slower than native, but universal ‚Äî works on any interface

**Offloaded Mode**

- Moves the eBPF program into the NIC firmware itself (for SmartNICs).
- Requires NIC and firmware support But provides fastest performance
- Ideal for hardware offloading and freeing up CPU

## XDP Verdicts
Your eBPF program returns a verdict to decide what to do with the packet:

- XDP_DROP:  Drop the packet immediately
- XDP_PASS:  Let it continue into the kernel stack
- XDP_REDIRECT:  Redirect to another interface or AF_XDP socket
- XDP_TX:  Send the packet back out the same interface
- XDP_ABORTED:  For debugging, if the program hits a fault
- Each verdict is a fast, deterministic decision, giving you granular control with minimal latency.

## What‚Äôs the UPF(User Plane Function)?
The User Plane Function (UPF) is the heart of the 5G data plane, positioned between the RAN (gNB) and the external data network (DN). In simple terms, the UPF is a core network component responsible for handling all user data ‚Äî such as internet traffic, video, and voice ‚Äî that flows between your device (e.g., phone) and the outside world (like websites or streaming services). Essentially, the UPF acts as the main ‚Äútraffic controller‚Äù in a 5G network, ensuring that data packets are routed quickly and efficiently to their destinations. It handles:

- GTP-U tunneling/decapsulation
- IP forwarding / NAT
- QoS and policing
- Lawful Interception
- Traffic classification
- Usage metering
- Interaction with the SMF(Session Management Function(Control Plane))

## What Makes a Desired UPF in 5G/6G?
With the explosion of ultra-connected services ‚Äî from AR/VR to autonomous cars ‚Äî the User Plane Function (UPF) has become a critical element of the 5G and upcoming 6G core. A truly modern UPF must do more than just route packets ‚Äî it must adapt, scale, and perform under diverse workloads.

Here are the 10 must-have characteristics of an ideal UPF:

1) Ultra-Low Latency (URLLC Ready)

    Sub-millisecond processing required for mission-critical, real-time apps.

2) High Throughput

    Multi-Gbps capacity with minimal per-packet overhead.

3) Horizontal Scalability

    Easily deployable across pods/cores/edges, supporting elastic scaling in Kubernetes.

4) ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Native Architecture

    Stateless microservices, container-friendly, and CI/CD integrable.

5) Programmability

    Dynamic insertion of policies, metering, traffic shaping, DPI, etc.

6) Robust Flow and Session Management

    Supports GTP-U tunnels, PFCP sessions, FARs, QERs with fast table lookups.

7) Security + Isolation

    Integrated ACLs, per-slice flow enforcement, anti-spoofing, rate-limiting.

8) Observability and Telemetry

    Built-in tracing, flow accounting, Prometheus/Grafana-friendly.

9) Hardware Agnostic

    Runs on general-purpose NICs; does not require SmartNICs or DPDK-only setups.

10) Resilient and Fault-Tolerant

Survives failovers, upgrades, and scales without packet loss.

## Where Traditional UPFs Fall Short
Most legacy or software-based UPFs process traffic at the application layer, going through:

- Full kernel stack traversal (routing, tc, Netfilter)
- sk_buff allocation and copy overhead
- Context switching and userspace interactions

This makes them ill-suited for high-performance requirements, especially:

- URLLC: High latency due to kernel traversal
- High Throughput: CPU-bound at high PPS (packets/sec)

## DPDK UPFs ‚Äî Speed with Strings Attached
DPDK was introduced to overcome kernel overheads, and indeed delivers impressive performance via:

- Kernel bypass
- Zero-copy memory
- User-space polling
However, it brings major limitations:

- Hardware dependency: Requires NICs with DPDK support (e.g., vfio-pci, uio)
- Poor Kubernetes compatibility: Needs pinned CPUs, hugepages, and non-standard CNI setups
- Limited Observability: Doesn‚Äôt integrate well with Linux tools or eBPF observability stack
- Rigid Scaling: Hardware-specific scaling bottlenecks, poor elasticity

## üêù eBPF/XDP UPFs
eBPF/XDP-based UPFs represent a shift toward a cloud-native, kernel-integrated dataplane that:

- Delivers near-DPDK performance without hardware lock-in
(XDP-native mode)
- Runs in kernel, avoiding context switches, memory copy
- Integrates into containerized/Kubernetes environments natively
- Supports observability via BPF maps, tracepoints, and perf events
- Is fully programmable using maps, helpers, and attachable programs
- Scales effortlessly across nodes, cores, and interfaces

Whether it‚Äôs a 5G core on bare metal or a 6G edge cloud pod, eBPF based UPFs adapt with programmability, scalability, and performance ‚Äî without compromise.

To replicate and perform these tests on your own hardware, you can follow the repository linked below.

**Key Observations**

eUPF (XDP-based, native mode) leads in raw throughput but at the cost of higher CPU consumption, especially for downlink.
UPG-VPP shows the best latency performance, being under 0.16 ms in most measurements.
Open5GS performs well for basic setups but lacks scalability.
free5GC offers middle-ground performance but not close to eBPF/VPP variants.
All results depend heavily on virtualization platform, NIC driver support (virtio), and test environment.

## The Future of eBPF in 6G, AI-Native Networks
As we look ahead to the evolution from 5G to 6G, networks will demand ultra-low latency, AI-native orchestration, and extreme programmability. This is where eBPF emerges not just as a performance enhancer ‚Äî but as a cornerstone of next-gen infrastructure.

In 6G, where distributed intelligence is key, eBPF can serve as an in-kernel decision engine to enforce AI-driven policies directly at the dataplane.
AI-native networks will require continuous learning from traffic flows. eBPF‚Äôs hooks and real-time telemetry collection (via perf events, tracepoints, and custom maps) make it ideal for integrating with ML pipelines for self-optimizing networks.
Smart NICs and DPU/XPUs are already supporting eBPF offloading. This allows pushing UPF workloads entirely onto programmable NICs, reducing CPU load and increasing energy efficiency ‚Äî a critical concern for hyperscale 6G edge deployments.
